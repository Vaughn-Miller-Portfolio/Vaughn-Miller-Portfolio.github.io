			<h1>My Projects</h1>
			
			<h2>Racecar Telemetry & DAQ</h2>
			<h3>Fall 2021 to Present</h3>
			<p>
				I have been a member of the ISU Formula SAE team known as Cyclone Racing since 2020. During my tenure, I have been 
				a member, a leader, and a student of many skilled individuals before me. Our goal is to design, build, and race a
				formula-style vehicle that can not only hold up to the rigor of a competition, but also the judgement of seasoned 
				professionals across several engineering disciplines. 
				</p><p>
				Computers are present in all modern production vehicles, but also in those built to race. Although there
				is an existing market for data collection equipment, a massive hurdle that FSAE faces is gathering adequate funding
				to support the manufacturing process involved with building a racecar. By designing our own dashboard and data 
				acquisition system, several thousands of dollars that would otherwise be spent on this equipment can be
				put towards purchasing the expensive materials and processes necessary to build an innovative machine. 
				</p><p>
				One benefit we determined early on, was the flexibility in how we could process and view data on a system that is not
				bound by proprietary software or accessories. This enabled the computer and electrical engineers to collaborate and 
				produce a device that can use a wider variety of sensors, receive data from the engine computer, display important
				information to the driver, and wirelessly transmit a customizable data stream to a computer in realtime. All for a 
				small fraction of the price a plug-and-play system would cost, with a host of engineering lessons along the way.
				I led the initial iterations of development for this system with a handful of other students, and will continue to 
				work on improving upon our team's design until I graduate in the Fall of 2024.
				</p><p>
				On Cyclone Racing, I learned how to program a variety of microcontroller systems, starting with Arduino (AVR) based 
				boards, and now shifting towards the more powerful ARM family of microcontrollers. Sensor data, both analog and digital, 
				is also something I enjoyed learning about. The most valuable thing I gathered was the variety of ways it can be manipulated 
				or processed to provide the most meaningful output to other engineers. I also learned how CAN bus works from the
				electrical level up to how a microcontroller uses CAN messages to communicate information quickly and efficiently. The 
				telemetry system our team designed and the data it provided is credited with allowing the 2023 CR-27 
				iteration of the Cyclone Racing car to finish within the threshold of engine failure at an unofficial 2023 competition, 
				earning a 2nd place result.
				The bulk of my skills in embedded C/C++ programming were derived from my experience on this team. Git, Github, Altium,
				and a plethora of data from manufacturers and users alike were all important in this project as well. 
			</p>
			
			

			
			<h2>Drivetrain Swap</h2>
			<h3>Winter 2021</h3>
			<p>
				Although not a computer specific project, this is a personal endeavor that taught me several practical skills
				that can be applied to my career. My personal vehicle developed engine damage during the autumn of 2021, and I could
				not afford to outright buy a new car. I spent a few months gathering documentation, getting advice from mechanics and 
				other professionals, and researching the process involved with installing a new engine.
				</p><p>
				During winter break that year I purchased an engine from a junkyard, and also several parts online. For the entirety of
				December, I slowly and carefully disassembled my only form of transportation with hand tools, and prepared the new
				engine I had purchased with a specific combination of old and new parts to ensure maximum compatibility of my car with
				the new drivetrain. There were frequent obstacles present during this repair. I often needed to explore how certain
				materials interacted with each other, how certain metals reacted to different temperatures, or how tools could be used together
				to solve these problems. Everything I learned proved essential in getting this car back on the road. Planning ahead and being 
				able to visualize a solution in my head to plan and measure for was also a skill I improved upon.
				</p><p>
				I would now consider myself proficient in knowing how to use the majority of common hand tools, power tools, and fasteners
				required for most vehicle repairs. In some sense, I have also learned some of the 'wrong' ways to use these items when
				specialty tools are not available, or a solution is required in a time-sensitive environment. I also gained some experience
				in fabrication, such as in cutting and welding, but would not consider myself advanced in this area. In the end, this car 
				required	yet another engine. I learned from the mistakes that I made the first time, and halved the time required to produce a 
				far-superior end result. 
			</p>

			<h2>Computer Engineering 288 Robot</h2>
			<h3>Fall 2022</h3>
			<p>
				Every major-specific class has offered me an excellent chance to learn valuable information, but few apply the knowledge
				gained so directly as CprE 288 did. This was my first experience with programming a microcontroller beyond the simple
				and straightforward approach that Arduino offers.
				</p><p>
				With the help of a lab partner and the teaching assistants for the class, I was tasked with programming a Roomba-based
				robot to read analog sensor data, convert it to digital data, and utilize the numbers it acquired to navigate a course
				specified by the professor. The robot is fitted a Texas Instruments ARM controller, not unlike the ARM 
				controllers I now use in FSAE, that acts as the 'brain' of the machine. To program this type of processor, a deep 
				understanding of how a processor's many parts work together is crucial. A datasheet is utilized heavily as well, 
				which is an extensive document detailing how to access, change, and configure the many small parts of an ARM controller
				into a system that handles input and delivers output appropriately. Only then can a program be written to enable the
				many motors and sensors of this robot to interface with logical steps in C++ code to detect obstacles, move to avoid them,
				and reach a final stopping point.
				</p><p>
				My knowledge of C++ was again tested and expanded upon, but moreso was my ability to read and understand the documentation
				that is capable of providing an engineer with the necessary tools to complete a complex task. I admit that what I did to contribute to this project
				was not to the best of my ability, but it did teach me how to approach future problems, keeping in mind how to delegate an appropriate
				workload to each member of an engineering team, my own responsibilities included.

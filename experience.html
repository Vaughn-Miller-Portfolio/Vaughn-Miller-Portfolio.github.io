			<h1>Professional Experience</h1>
			
			<h2>Businessolver | Internship</h2>
			<h3>Software Engineer Intern, Summer 2022</h3>
			<p>
				Businessolver is a web development consulting company, tasked with handling sensitive information for a large client base.
				They require robust data management and site performance/security. As a Software Engineering Intern,
				I worked with a small team of engineers to handle rapid deployment of fixes and updates to help the
				company migrate to improved technology, and patch the legacy code base to ensure that what was currently
				in use would continue to function safely and securely. 
				</p><p>
				My performance and expected results were evaluated by the project manager of our team, as well as the mentor I
				shared progress with. I routinely gave virtual presentations outlining my progress through my assigned tasks, where
				I needed help, and what I could do to help my team. 
				</p><p>
				I learned how to use the IntelliJ development environment, AWS and SQL database commands, how to interpret 
				basic Javascript, how to use Git and CI/CD, and exercised prior Java debugging skills. My team also used a 
				SCRUM-based framework, in order to structure our work efficiently. I learned how to summarize my contributions for a
				short presentation, and how to ask for help in a way that led to a solution, or part of one. 
			</p>

			<h2>Pratt & Miller Engineering | Co-op</h2>
			<h3>Controls Engineering Intern, Spring 2023</h3>
			<p>
				Pratt & Miller Engineering is a defense, mobility, and motorsport focused company based in Grand Rapids, MI.
				They have a rich legacy of success in motorsport, and have carried that legacy into autonomous vehicle technology,
				human and cargo transport, electric vehicle systems, as well as continued innovation in the motorsport industry.
				As a computer engineer in the controls division, I worked on a variety of systems and testing procedures to engineer
				a safe and cutting-edge successor to the current USPS delivery vehicle. 
				</p><p>
				High-level project deadlines provided the main structure around how my work was conducted and paced, so the majority
				of the daily tasks and progression were done at my own pace. I worked closely with an experienced engineer, and reported
				progress on a weekly basis to the portion of the controls division tasked with development of the delivery vehicle. 
				Small presentations and updates were required, which helped facilitate an environment conducive to consistent progress.
				A SCRUM-like framework was employed in a flexible way to track how each engineer was doing on an individual basis,
				and the familiarity I had with such a structure in my previous internship proved to be helpful.
				</p><p>
				I learned how to use industry standard Vector hardware and software to debug communication buses, as
				well as monitor them for behavior to note for later testing. I also used Simulink to model ECU networks to be used 
				in a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) testing platform. Electrical component diagramming and part specifications were also
				a part of the testing process, where a physical analog to a system needed to be designed and created apart from
				the entire vehicle. Knowledge of C++, Matlab, Python, and the principles of CAN buses were also crucial to me as a 
				member of this engineering team.

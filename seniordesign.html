			<h2>Senior Design: WDAQ</h2>
			<h3>2024</h3>
			<p>
				Senior design provides an opportunity for students nearing the end of their undergraduate program to exercise the
				skills and knowledge they have learned, as well as some they might not have yet, in order to complete a truly
				professional-level engineering challenge. My team chose to develop a wireless data aquisition (WDAQ) device to be used
				in animal research as a way to view and log a high-resolution stream of realtime data from an ultrasonic source.
				This project aims to aid researchers in conducting ultrasonic imagery by reducing the amount of setup and external tools
				required for their job, while giving the best results possible to them.
				</p><p>
				There are several disciplines necessary to create a functional device to satisfy the speciications given to us.
				The signal received by the WDAQ must be processed at the electrical level to stay within a specific range of 
				frequencies and amplified to a minimum power, so that it can be accurately turned into a digital number, sent 
				as a stream of data points from a microcontroller to a wireless transmitter, and finally to a computer. These
				objectives require knowledge of electrical circuits, signals, electronics documentation, diagrams, programming, 
				and visual software in order to be completed.
				</p><p>
				As a computer engineer, I am responsibile for converting the amplified and filtered sound wave signal
				into numbers that a computer can use. I then program an ARM microcontroller to package that number neatly into a 
				message to send to a wireless transmitter, which then sends the message to a computer that a veterinary 
				technician or researcher would be using. The quality of the signal propagates through the entire system, so a 
				well-designed combination of the parts required will assist in reaching the goal of an accurate signal at the output.
